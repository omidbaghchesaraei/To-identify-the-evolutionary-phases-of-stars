# To-identify-the-evolutionary-phases-of-stars
Once the hydrogen at the center of a star has been exhausted, the star evolves off the main sequence into the red giant branch(RGB). When the helium ignites, the star then enters the next phase of nuclear burning, known as the helium-burning phase (HeB). The purpose of this project is to classify the evolutionary phase [RGB/HeB]. 
My first step is to compare 9 classic machine learning algorithms using Accuracy and ROC curves, Precision-Recall curves, and Confusion Matrix. 
 Then, I used five neural network models to find out which one has the best performance and accuracy and understood there is no big difference between them in terms of accuracy, but they have their own characteristics in terms of loss graphs. In the first four models in loss graphs, the slope of validation loss increased as layers were added. There is one thing in common between them: Severe fluctuations after the local minimum in loss graphs. This is a sign of overfitting.
